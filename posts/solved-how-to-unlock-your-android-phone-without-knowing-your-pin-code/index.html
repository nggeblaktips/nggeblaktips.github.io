Fortunately, there are several proven methods you can now use to unlock your android phone pin lock if forgotten.</p><p>One such method is using your Google account. You can use your Google account to reset the pin and gain access to your phone again.

Subsequently, you will be asked to enter your Google account log in information. Upon successful entry, you will be logged in and given the option to unlock the screen.</p><p>Another method to unlock an android phone pin lock if forgotten is to use your Samsung account.

Once you are logged in, you can unlock the pin.</p><p>Thirdly, android phones can be unlocked using the Find My Device feature on your phone. This is especially beneficial for those who have an older version of android that may not have the other two options. To access the feature, you need to log into your Google account on a computer and open the Find My Device page. From there, you can select the option to unlock your phone.</p><p>Finally, you can also opt for the factory reset option to unlock your android phone pin lock if forgotten. However, be aware that this will delete all the data from your phone, so make sure you have a backup beforehand.</p><h3 id=2-pros--cons-of-unlocking-solutions>2.
