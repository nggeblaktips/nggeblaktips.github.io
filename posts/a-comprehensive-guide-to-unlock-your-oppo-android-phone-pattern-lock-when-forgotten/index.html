Steps to Reset Pattern Lock On Oppo Android Phone<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-steps-to-reset-pattern-lock-on-oppo-android-phone>#</a></h3><p>Forgetting the pattern lock to an Oppo Android phone can be very frustrating. Luckily, there are a few ways to get back into your phone depending on the type of device you have. Here are three tips to help you remember your Oppo Android pattern lock if you ever forget it.</p><p>First, try entering the PIN you may have set up in case you forget the pattern. If this does not work, you may have to resort to factory resetting your phone. This process will delete all data from your phone, including apps and personal files, so make sure you back them up before attempting it.</p><p>Another tip is to use Android Device Manager. With this, you can remotely lock and unlock your device, as well as reset the screen lock. The only downside to this is that you need to have previously enabled the feature in your settings.</p><p>Finally, Google and Oppo also provide a service to help you unlock your device. Simply retrieve your phone’s IMEI number and enter it into the website. Once you successfully enter the number, you should be able to follow the on-screen instructions to unlock your phone.</p><p>Regardless of the method you choose, remember to back up your phone regularly, especially if you find yourself often forgetting your pattern. This way, you won’t lose your data and files when you need to reset your phone.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/c4asBv8VUV0 style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q1: What is a pattern lock on an Oppo Android phone?
