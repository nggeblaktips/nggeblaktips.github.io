Other Options for Tracking a Lost or Stolen Android Phone If you’re looking for options to help you locate your Android phone that is turned off, there are a few routes you can take. Google’s Find my Device can be used to locate your phone and manage your device remotely. Another option is to use third-party apps like Cerberus and Prey to help track a missing phone. Additionally, you can also use IMEI tracking and call your service provider to help in the search. Here are the steps you need to take to use each option.\nGoogle’s Find my Device allows you to remotely locate, lock, or erase your device.

The user needs to have enabled ADM on the device to allow tracking and remote controls. To use it, the user simply needs to go to the Android Device Manager website, sign in with the same Google account used on the phone, and locate the device.\nThird-party tracking and security apps are available to help locate lost or stolen phones that are turned off.
