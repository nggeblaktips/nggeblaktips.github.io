Don’t despair! In this article, we’ll show you how to turn on your Android phone when the power button is malfunctioning. It’s a very tragic moment when your Android’s power button is not working. However, no worries, because you can still turn it on. In this article, I’ll be sharing with you some interesting ways to turn on your Android phone when the power button is malfunctioning.\nThe first method is quite simple. All you need to do is to find a USB-C cable and connect it to your phone. Then, you will need to download and install an app called ‘Button Mapper’. This app will allow you to assign specific functions to other buttons on your device. From there, you can assign the power button to any other button, such as the volume up or down button.\nThe second method is a bit more complicated. You will need to open the back cover of your phone and locate the power button. Then, you will have to remove the power button and open up a tiny circuit board. You will then need to solder a new wired button onto the circuit board. Make sure that the new button is pressed down firmly enough so that the power button can be activated.\nThe third method is something you may not have thought possible. It involves using a virtual assistant, such as Google Now or Alexa, to turn on your phone. All you need to do is ask the assistant to ‘Turn on my phone’. Once this is done, your phone will be powered on.\nThese are some of the ways you can turn on your Android device when the power button is not working. All you need to do is choose the method that best suits your needs and you’ll be able to keep your phone running in no time.\nAccording to Android Authority, “It’s not uncommon to experience power button failure on any device, particularly on mobile phones that have been subjected to physical damage”\nAccording to TechGuidance, a power button failure can still be fixed without any repair, as most Samsung phones come with a feature called “Side Key Panel” which can be used to switch on the phone without using the power button.\nAccording to Statista, about 75% of the global market share in 2020 is occupied by Android OS, making it one of the leading OS in the world, which further indicates the importance of making sure the power button of an Android phone is in perfect working condition.\n1. How to Power On Android Device Manually The power button on your Android device is one of its most important components. It not only lets you turn the device on and off, but it also lets you quickly access other tasks. But what if the power button stops working? Fortunately, there are several ways to manually power on your device without having to use the power button. Here are some of them:\nUse a USB cable. By connecting your phone to your computer with a USB cable, you can easily power it on. Make sure your computer is already turned on before attempting this method.\nUse an external power source. Some phones have a special port that can be used to power on your device without the power button. Keep in mind that this option isn’t available on all Android phones.\nUse ADB commands. Android Debug Bridge (ADB) can be used to power on Android devices if they are connected to a computer. To do this, you will need the device drivers and command-line tools from the Android SDK.\nUse the Volume and Home button. This method is a bit tricky, but it works on most Android devices. Hold down the Volume down and Home buttons while pressing the power button. Keep them pressed until your device turns on.\nBy understanding how to power on your Android devices manually, you won’t have to worry about your power button not working. Just make sure you try out all of the mentioned tricks until one of them works for your device.\n1. Using ADB Command Sometimes, the power button on your android device can cease to work. If this happens, the phone can’t be turned on with the usual method. But luckily, there are alternative methods to power on your device. This tutorial will guide you on how to turn on android phone when power button is not working.\nFirst of all, try plugging in your device to a charger. More often than not, this will be enough to power up your device. If that doesn’t work, your next step would be to connect your device to a computer with a reliable USB cable. Once plugged in, your device should be powered up.\nIf you are still unable to power up the device, the next option would be to access your device’s secondary boot menu. This menu can be accessed by using certain combination of buttons such as volume buttons and power button. Each combination of button varies between devices. You will need to find out which button combination is correct for your particular device.\nFinally, if all else fails, you can try removing the phone battery for around 10 minutes and then replace the battery. After that, your device should be able to power up.\nBy following the steps mentioned above, you should be able to power on your device manually when the power button is not working.\n2. Taking Out the Battery Although it is probably unlikely, sometimes power buttons on android devices can become unresponsive. In such cases, the device remains completely shut down and won’t turn on, leaving the user no choice but using an alternative method to reboot the phone. Fortunately, Android provides alternative ways to power on a device without the need for the physical power button. In this tutorial, we’ll explain how to turn on an Android device when the power button is not working.\nThe easiest way to turn on an Android phone when the power button is not working is to connect it to a charger and use the power button on the charger cable. This should cause the phone to boot up, letting the user unlock the phone and use it as normal.\nAnother method involves removing the device’s back cover and disconnecting and reconnecting the battery from the device. This should also cause the phone to turn on, though it does void the phone’s warranty so it’s not recommended if possible.\nFinally, if the phone doesn’t have a removable battery, users may be able to use ADB to turn on the device without the need for the power button. Firstly, users must install the Android SDK on their computer and enable USB debugging on their device. Once done, the user can connect their device to the computer and execute the command “adb shell input keyevent 26” to turn on the device.\nBy following any of these methods, users should be able to turn on their Android device when the power button is not working.\n2. Common Solutions to Fix Malfunctioning Power Button One of the most annoying problems an Android user can face is when their power button fails. While the power button is used to turn a device on, if it malfunctions, it can be difficult to get the device to fire up. In this tutorial, we’ll explain some common solutions to use when you have a malfunctioning power button.\nForce Start Your Android. This is the easiest method to get your phone working without using the power button. You can force start your Android device by holding down the volume down button and the home button simultaneously for about five seconds. Once your device vibrates, you can release the buttons and your Android will boot up.\nUse an App to Start Your Android. If the device still doesn’t turn on, you can try downloading an app. There are several apps available on the Play Store that can help you start your Android device without the power button. For instance, an app like Power Button to Volume Button can activate your device using the volume buttons instead of the power button.\nUse a Portable Battery to Jumpstart Your Android. For this method, you will need a portable battery and a USB connection to connect your Android to the battery. Once you have connected your device, press and hold the power button until the device starts.\nUse an On/Off Switch with a USB Connector. You can buy an On/Off switch with a USB connector that can be connected to your Android device. Once connected, simply turn on the switch to start your device.\n1. Use Alternative Button Combination Many people use Android phones but are sometimes confused about how to turn on their device when the power button stops working. Don’t worry, there are still some solutions to help you turn on the device. The most common and simple solution is to connect your device to the charger, then wait for a few moments before the device will turn on automatically. Another solution is to remove the battery from the device and insert it back into the phone. This option may be beneficial for devices that are not removable. Lastly, you can try to press the Volume Up and Volume Down buttons simultaneously until the device turns on.\nThese solutions should help you turn on your device as long as the issue is not caused by hardware damage. It is also a good idea to take your phone to a professional repair shop if the solutions mentioned above don’t work. They will be able to help you determine the cause of the malfunction. It is also important to backup your device regularly to ensure that you don’t lose important information if your device ever fails to turn on.\n2. Charge Your Phone Returns Power Power button malfunctions can be very annoying and it can lead to difficulty in powering on the phone. Here are some solutions that you can try if your phone’s power button has stopped working.\nThe first solution is to try using a different button combination. If your phone has a Home button at the bottom and a Volume button on the side, then try holding down both of these buttons simultaneously for five seconds or more to turn the phone on.\nThe second solution is to plug your phone in to a charger and let it charge for a few minutes before attempting to turn it on. This can help to reset the phone’s system and allow it to power up.\nThe third solution is to remove the battery from the phone and then plug it back in. It takes a few minutes to turn the phone back on but this should help to fix any issues related to the power button.\nFinally, if all of these solutions fail, then you may need to take it to a phone repair shop to get it fixed. A professional can help to identify the problem and get your phone back working as usual.\n3. Alternatives to Power On Android Device Without Power Button It can be really inconvenient if your phone’s power button is not functioning properly, or if it has broken. Fret not, as there are alternatives to turn on your Android device without the power button. Here are three simple ways that require limited functionality on your phone.\nThe first method is to enable USB debugging and connect your phone to the computer. This will automatically turn your device on. However, if USB debugging isn’t enabled, connecting the charger alone to your Android device can turn it on.\nThe second method is to remove the battery from the device and put it back in. This will also power up the device without using the power button.\nThe third and last method is to press the Volume button and the Home button/Center button simultaneously. This will generally power up the device as well.\nThese three alternative methods can be useful when your power button is malfunctioning or totally broken. It can help you to get your device up and running again.\n1. Utilize Alternative Option to Power On Device Modern smartphones are largely built around the power button. It’s the one physical button we use to do many things, from unlocking the device to restarting it. But what happens when your phone’s power button is not working? Don’t panic, there are plenty of ways to power on your Android device without using the power button.\nThe first thing to try is a combination of buttons. If your device has a volume rocker and you are able to press it, continue holding it down and then press and hold the power button until the device turns on. This trick usually works with most Samsung and Huawei phones.\nFor devices without volume buttons, you can also use a combination of hardware buttons. Pressing and holding the “home button” and “volume up” simultaneously should turn on your Android phone. For some devices, “volume down” and “home button” may also work.\nAnother option is to plug in your device to a power source, then press the “volume down” button and hold it for a few seconds. This should turn on your device. It’s a great workaround if you don’t have access to a PC or laptop.\nLastly, if all else fails, you should try and reset the device by pressing and holding the “home button” and “power button” for at least 10 seconds. This will erase all your data and you will have to set up your device again.\n2.

This can be very frustrating if you need to use your smartphone urgently. Fortunately, there are several ways to turn on an Android device if the power button is not working.\nOne way to turn on an Android device without using the power button is to use the home button. If your device is running on Android 4.0 or higher, all you need to do is press the home button for five seconds. This will bring up the power menu, which you can use to turn on the device.\nAnother option is to use a USB OTG (On-The-Go) cable. This allows you to connect your device to a computer, power bank, or any other device with a USB port. The device will then be able to draw power from the USB port, allowing you to turn it on without the power button.\nYou can also use an app to turn on your device. There are several apps available on the Google Play Store that allow you to control your device without using the physical buttons. These apps can be used to turn your device on or off and even to control the volume.\nFinally, if you are still unable to turn on your device, you can try a hard reset. This will reset your device to its factory settings and should enable you to turn it on without using the power button. It is important to note, however, that a hard reset will erase all data from your device, so be sure to back up any important files before proceeding.\nQ1: How can I turn on my Android phone when the power button does not work?

In this tutorial, we&rsquo;ll explain how to turn on an Android device when the power button is not working.</p><p>The easiest way to turn on an Android phone when the power button is not working is to connect it to a charger and use the power button on the charger cable. This should cause the phone to boot up, letting the user unlock the phone and use it as normal.</p><p>Another method involves removing the device&rsquo;s back cover and disconnecting and reconnecting the battery from the device. This should also cause the phone to turn on, though it does void the phone&rsquo;s warranty so it’s not recommended if possible.</p><p>Finally, if the phone doesn&rsquo;t have a removable battery, users may be able to use ADB to turn on the device without the need for the power button. Firstly, users must install the Android SDK on their computer and enable USB debugging on their device. Once done, the user can connect their device to the computer and execute the command “adb shell input keyevent 26” to turn on the device.</p><p>By following any of these methods, users should be able to turn on their Android device when the power button is not working.</p><h2 id=2-common-solutions-to-fix-malfunctioning-power-button>2. Common Solutions to Fix Malfunctioning Power Button<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-common-solutions-to-fix-malfunctioning-power-button>#</a></h2><p>One of the most annoying problems an Android user can face is when their power button fails. While the power button is used to turn a device on, if it malfunctions, it can be difficult to get the device to fire up. In this tutorial, we&rsquo;ll explain some common solutions to use when you have a malfunctioning power button.</p><p>Force Start Your Android. This is the easiest method to get your phone working without using the power button. You can force start your Android device by holding down the volume down button and the home button simultaneously for about five seconds. Once your device vibrates, you can release the buttons and your Android will boot up.</p><p>Use an App to Start Your Android. If the device still doesn&rsquo;t turn on, you can try downloading an app. There are several apps available on the Play Store that can help you start your Android device without the power button. For instance, an app like Power Button to Volume Button can activate your device using the volume buttons instead of the power button.</p><p>Use a Portable Battery to Jumpstart Your Android. For this method, you will need a portable battery and a USB connection to connect your Android to the battery. Once you have connected your device, press and hold the power button until the device starts.</p><p>Use an On/Off Switch with a USB Connector. You can buy an On/Off switch with a USB connector that can be connected to your Android device. Once connected, simply turn on the switch to start your device.</p><h3 id=1-use-alternative-button-combination>1. Use Alternative Button Combination<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#1-use-alternative-button-combination>#</a></h3><p>Many people use Android phones but are sometimes confused about how to turn on their device when the power button stops working. Don&rsquo;t worry, there are still some solutions to help you turn on the device. The most common and simple solution is to connect your device to the charger, then wait for a few moments before the device will turn on automatically. Another solution is to remove the battery from the device and insert it back into the phone. This option may be beneficial for devices that are not removable. Lastly, you can try to press the Volume Up and Volume Down buttons simultaneously until the device turns on.</p><p>These solutions should help you turn on your device as long as the issue is not caused by hardware damage. It is also a good idea to take your phone to a professional repair shop if the solutions mentioned above don&rsquo;t work. They will be able to help you determine the cause of the malfunction. It is also important to backup your device regularly to ensure that you don&rsquo;t lose important information if your device ever fails to turn on.</p><h3 id=2-charge-your-phone-returns-power>2.

Here are some solutions that you can try if your phone&rsquo;s power button has stopped working.</p><p>The first solution is to try using a different button combination. If your phone has a Home button at the bottom and a Volume button on the side, then try holding down both of these buttons simultaneously for five seconds or more to turn the phone on.</p><p>The second solution is to plug your phone in to a charger and let it charge for a few minutes before attempting to turn it on. This can help to reset the phone&rsquo;s system and allow it to power up.</p><p>The third solution is to remove the battery from the phone and then plug it back in. It takes a few minutes to turn the phone back on but this should help to fix any issues related to the power button.</p><p>Finally, if all of these solutions fail, then you may need to take it to a phone repair shop to get it fixed.

Alternatives to Power On Android Device Without Power Button<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#3-alternatives-to-power-on-android-device-without-power-button>#</a></h2><p>It can be really inconvenient if your phone&rsquo;s power button is not functioning properly, or if it has broken. Fret not, as there are alternatives to turn on your Android device without the power button. Here are three simple ways that require limited functionality on your phone.</p><p>The first method is to enable USB debugging and connect your phone to the computer. This will automatically turn your device on.

This will also power up the device without using the power button.</p><p>The third and last method is to press the Volume button and the Home button/Center button simultaneously. This will generally power up the device as well.</p><p>These three alternative methods can be useful when your power button is malfunctioning or totally broken. It can help you to get your device up and running again.</p><h3 id=1-utilize-alternative-option-to-power-on-device>1. Utilize Alternative Option to Power On Device<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#1-utilize-alternative-option-to-power-on-device>#</a></h3><p>Modern smartphones are largely built around the power button. It’s the one physical button we use to do many things, from unlocking the device to restarting it. But what happens when your phone’s power button is not working? Don’t panic, there are plenty of ways to power on your Android device without using the power button.</p><p>The first thing to try is a combination of buttons. If your device has a volume rocker and you are able to press it, continue holding it down and then press and hold the power button until the device turns on. This trick usually works with most Samsung and Huawei phones.</p><p>For devices without volume buttons, you can also use a combination of hardware buttons. Pressing and holding the “home button” and “volume up” simultaneously should turn on your Android phone. For some devices, “volume down” and “home button” may also work.</p><p>Another option is to plug in your device to a power source, then press the “volume down” button and hold it for a few seconds. This should turn on your device. It’s a great workaround if you don’t have access to a PC or laptop.</p><p>Lastly, if all else fails, you should try and reset the device by pressing and holding the “home button” and “power button” for at least 10 seconds. This will erase all your data and you will have to set up your device again.</p><h3 id=2-other-potential-solutions-to-power-on-device>2. Other Potential Solutions to Power On Device<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-other-potential-solutions-to-power-on-device>#</a></h3><p>The power button is one of the most important components of any Android device. If it is not working properly, the device will not turn on. This can be very frustrating if you need to use your smartphone urgently. Fortunately, there are several ways to turn on an Android device if the power button is not working.</p><p>One way to turn on an Android device without using the power button is to use the home button. If your device is running on Android 4.0 or higher, all you need to do is press the home button for five seconds. This will bring up the power menu, which you can use to turn on the device.</p><p>Another option is to use a USB OTG (On-The-Go) cable. This allows you to connect your device to a computer, power bank, or any other device with a USB port. The device will then be able to draw power from the USB port, allowing you to turn it on without the power button.</p><p>You can also use an app to turn on your device. There are several apps available on the Google Play Store that allow you to control your device without using the physical buttons. These apps can be used to turn your device on or off and even to control the volume.</p><p>Finally, if you are still unable to turn on your device, you can try a hard reset. This will reset your device to its factory settings and should enable you to turn it on without using the power button. It is important to note, however, that a hard reset will erase all data from your device, so be sure to back up any important files before proceeding.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/1TnPiP_0Z70 style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q1: How can I turn on my Android phone when the power button does not work?
