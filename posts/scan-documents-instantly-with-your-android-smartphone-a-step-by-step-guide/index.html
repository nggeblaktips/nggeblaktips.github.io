Keep the camera steady while photographing the document as a certainty of a blur-free image.</p><p>Secondly, when capturing the document, make sure the background of the image is well lit and clear. This will help the text to standout and be more legible. While taking the picture, make sure to not have any other items or objects in the background, which can distract from the subject.</p><p>Thirdly, shoot the document at the highest resolution possible. A higher resolution scan enables the image to be printed better and retain detail. For a better zoom-in, shooting at a higher resolution will allow for a better stock of information.</p><p>Lastly, use an editing tool to further enhance the document image. Tools like Adobe Lightroom, Snapseed etc. help to adjust brightness, contrast, crop, blur, and sharpen the image. As the final step, save the image in the preferred format, such as JPG or PDF, so that the document can be sent or printed.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/P6vOgae2AJk style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q1.
