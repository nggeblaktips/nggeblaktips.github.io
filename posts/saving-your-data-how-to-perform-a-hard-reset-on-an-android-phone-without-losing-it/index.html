It seems like a daunting task at first, especially as it involves breaking down the phone to its basic components, but here I will break down how you can do this without losing any of your precious data.\nThe process begins with turning off the phone and connecting it to a computer with a USB cable. Once connected, the phone is bootstrapped, and you can navigate to the settings menu and select the “backup and reset” option. This will allow you to back up your important files, such as contacts, emails, and other data as an image. This image is then stored in a secure location, and will be accessible to you even after hard resetting the phone.\nNext, you will go to the “factory reset” option in the settings. This will wipe the phone clean of all stored data, and reset the phone to its initial state. After the reset is complete, your backed up data can be easily restored, meaning you won’t be losing any important information in the process.\nFinally, you’ll need to install a new operating system on the phone. This can be done by downloading the latest version of Android, and following the instructions to install it on the device. Once the OS is installed, you can then proceed to personalize your phone and transfer any new data or applications that you may need.\nAs you can see, performing a hard reset on an Android phone doesn’t have to be a difficult or cumbersome process. With a few simple steps, you can easily save your data and restore it when you’re ready- ensuring that you never lose your important information when resetting your phone.\nAccording to a survey done by Google, more than 70% of Android users backed up their data using the Android backup services. This means that the data is saved securely and can be retrieved even after a hard reset.\nPC Mag released an article stating that a good way to perform a hard reset without losing your data is to back up your data with your Google account first. After that, you should go through the process of hard resetting your device and then restoring all of your backed up data.\nExternal backup services can also be used to save your data and restore them after a hard reset. Services like G-Cloud and Dropbox are recommended by experts as they offer secure file storage and can be accessed anywhere.\n1. What is Hard Reset? A hard reset, also known as a factory reset, will restore an Android phone to its original system state by clearing out the memory and restoring all original settings. It is necessary when you want to troubleshoot a device or reset all its data. Before performing a hard reset, it is important to back up all of the data stored on the device, including contacts, photos, music, and videos. Otherwise, all of the data will be erased.\nTo perform a hard reset, start by turning the device off and removing the battery if available. Then, press and hold the power button and volume-down key for five to twenty seconds at the same time. The device should then boot into its bootloader. From there, use the volume button to scroll to the Wipe data/factory reset option and press the power button to select it.\nAfter selecting the option, confirm the reset by scrolling to the Yes-delete all user data option and pressing the power button. This process may take a few minutes. Once it is complete, the device will reboot to its original factory settings. Make sure to back up all data prior to resetting as all of the device’s information will be lost and irrecoverable.\nFinally, it is important to note that a hard reset will also reset the phone’s software, which may mean that any previously installed software, updates, and settings will no longer be available. Additionally, any security codes or passwords that were previously set will be erased and will need to re-enter after the reset is complete.\n2. How to Hard Reset an Android Phone Without Losing Data Hard reset is when you restore your Android device to its factory default settings. It simply erases all your data such as installed applications, contacts, messages, photos and music files. This is the easiest way to make your device running fast again.

After about 10 seconds, you will hear a sound and your device will turn on with all the default settings. Be sure to back up your data before doing a hard reset as this will wipe out all the existing data. By following the steps above, you can do a hard reset on your Android device without losing any of your data and information.\n3.
