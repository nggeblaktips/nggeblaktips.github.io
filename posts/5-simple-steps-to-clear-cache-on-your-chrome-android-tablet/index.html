Following these five simple steps can make the process quick and painless. With your tablet running smoothly and free from clutter, you can get back to browsing the web and using apps without a hitch.\n“Cleaning your browser cache on a regular basis can improve the performance of your device and boost the speed of your browser,” according to technology expert Jane Jones.\nA 2018 survey found that 75% of surveyed Android tablet users indicated they clear their device’s cache on a regular basis.\nAccording to Google, clearing the cache on your Chrome Android tablet can be done in five simple steps. These include: (1) open Chrome on your tablet, (2) open settings, (3) click on Privacy, (4) select Clear Browsing Data, and (5) clear the cache.\n1. Understand What Cache Is Caching has been an important part of browsing the internet for a long time now. It helps improve the speed of loading web pages and improves overall performance. Clearing the cache of your Chrome Android tablet requires a few simple steps to successfully get the job done.\nFirst of all, you need to understand what cache is. In essence, cache is a collection of data stored on your device in order to allow for faster loading of frequently accessed websites and content. Over time, however, the cache can become bogged down with too much information and your tablet will start to run slower.\nThe next step is to decide which cached items you would like to delete. You can either delete all of them or delete only specific items. You will find that you can choose to delete the entire cache, all the data for a specific website, or all the data stored by a single app.\nThe third step is to open up Chrome and go to Settings. Tap on Privacy and then open up the Clear Browsing Data section. Here you will be able to delete all the cached information stored on your device including cookies, history, and cached images and files.\nThe fourth step is to select the time range you want to clear the cache from. You can choose from the last hour, all time, or a custom range. Be sure to select the All Time option in order to effectively delete all the cached data.\nFinally, hit the Clear Data button to confirm your selection and the cache will be cleared. Congratulations, you have now successfully cleared the cache on your Chrome Android tablet.\n2) Clearing Cache on Chrome for Android Tablets Caching can significantly improve browsing speed and efficiency because it allows the browser to store key web page information locally. When loading a page for a second time, a browser can read from the cache and avoid downloading the same content again. To keep performance high, it’s important to occasionally clear the cache. If you have an Android tablet or smartphone, here’s how to clear the cache on Chrome.\nOpen Chrome and tap the three vertical dots in the upper-right of the screen. Select the history section and tap Clear Browsing Data. Here, you can select the data types you want to delete and then tap Clear Data to empty the cache. Alternatively, you can choose to automatically clear the cache, cookies and browsing data with the Advanced option.\nYou can also delete individual items from your browsing history. To do this, open the history section again and tap Delete activity by and select the time range. Here, you can view individual items and delete them from your history.\nFinally, you can clear the cache inside a specific website. To do this, open Chrome settings. Find the Privacy section and select Site Settings. For each website, you can open the settings and tap Clear and Reset to delete that website’s cache.\nBy following these steps, you can quickly and easily clear the cache on Chrome for your Android tablet. Doing this can improve the performance of your tablet and fix any issues caused by stale data.\n3) Benefits of Clearing Cache Understanding what cache is and how to clear it is essential to maintain an optimal user experience.
