Deleting Voicemails on Samsung Android<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#1-deleting-voicemails-on-samsung-android>#</a></h3><p>Removing voicemails from your Samsung Android device can be easily done in several steps. To begin, open the Phone app that has the green phone icon. Go to the Voicemail tab and you will be able to see a list of all your voicemails. Select one of the voicemails that you want to delete and press the Delete icon located at the top right-hand corner of the Voicemail tab. You will then be prompted to confirm that you want to delete the voicemail. Once you have confirmed the deletion, the selected voicemail will be removed from your device.</p><p>The next step is to go to the Call Log tab located at the bottom right of the Phone app. Locate the voicemail that you have just deleted and press the Delete icon once more. This will permanently remove the voicemail from your device and it will no longer be available.</p><p>Android also has a feature that allows you to delete voicemails from a specific person or contact. To use this, open the Phone app and go to the Contacts tab. Select the name of a specific contact and press the Voicemail tab located at the top right of the contact page. You will be able to see a list of all voicemails related to that particular contact. Select the voicemails that you want to delete and press the Delete icon. This will delete the voicemails from your device and will no longer be accessible.</p><p>Deleting voicemails from your Samsung Android device is an easy process.

Wrapping Up<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-wrapping-up>#</a></h3><p>Voicemails can take up a lot of storage space on your Samsung Android device, so it is important to know how to delete them. Here are two easy steps to do that:</p><p>First, open the Phone app on your device and tap the Voicemail tab. You will see a list of all the voicemails on your device.</p><p>Second, select the voicemail that you want to delete and tap the delete icon. A confirmation message will appear to confirm the deletion. Once you have confirmed, the voicemail will be deleted from your device.</p><p>Bear in mind that this will only delete the voicemail from your device and not from the voicemail server. You will therefore still need to follow up with your service provider to delete the voicemail from the server.</p><p>Finally, once you have deleted all the voicemails you do not need, make sure to clear the cache. Clearing the cache will help your device run more efficiently. You can find the Cache deletion feature in the settings menu.</p><p>Following those two simple steps will help keep your Samsung Android device free from unnecessary voicemails and running smoothly.</p><h2 id=3-conclusion>3.
