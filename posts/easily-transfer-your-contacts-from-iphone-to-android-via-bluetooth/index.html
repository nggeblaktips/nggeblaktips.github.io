Transferring Contacts to Android<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-transferring-contacts-to-android>#</a></h3><p>Transferring contacts between different mobile operating systems can be a tedious and difficult task. However, if you have an iPhone and an Android device, transferring contacts between them can be easily done through Bluetooth. To begin, open up the Bluetooth settings on both your iPhone and Android device and ensure that they can detect one another. Next, open the Contacts app on your iPhone and select “Share Contact”. Select the contact you want to send and tap “Share Contact”. On the Android device, you will receive a prompt asking you to accept the request, press accept and the contact information will be transferred. This process can be repeated for multiple contacts as long as the devices remain paired via Bluetooth. Once all the contacts have been sent, the connection between the two devices can be manually disconnected. This method of transferring contacts is a quick and low-cost alternative and can be done without the use of a computer.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/o837qzZlFNA style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q1.
