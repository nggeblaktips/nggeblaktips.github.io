This will allow you to share files with your connected device, as well as other phones in your vicinity. All you need to do is open the app, select the desired files, and then press the “Send” button. This will prompt your data to begin transferring from one device to the other.\nFinally, if you’re migrating data between two Android phones that are running different versions of the OS, you’ll need to be sure to back-up your data to the cloud first. This will ensure that all of your personal data is securely stored before you make the switch. To back-up your data, navigate to the “Backup \u0026 Reset” option in your settings menu, and select the files that you would like to be saved.\nAs you can see, it’s relatively easy to move data between two Android phones without the help of Smart Switch.

This will ensure that all of your personal data is securely stored before you make the switch. To back-up your data, navigate to the &ldquo;Backup & Reset&rdquo; option in your settings menu, and select the files that you would like to be saved.</p><p>As you can see, it&rsquo;s relatively easy to move data between two Android phones without the help of Smart Switch.
