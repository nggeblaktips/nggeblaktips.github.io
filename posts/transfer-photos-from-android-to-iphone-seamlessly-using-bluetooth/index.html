Firstly, make sure that both your Android and iPhone&rsquo;s Bluetooth is enabled. Then, pair the two devices by ensuring that one device is designated as the sender and the other as the receiver. On the sender device, select the photos to be transferred and then choose the ‘Share via Bluetooth’ option. Once chosen, the photos should be sent to the receiver device. Finally, accept the incoming photos on the receiver device and the transfer should be complete.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://nggeblaktips.github.io/posts/solved-how-to-unlock-your-android-phone-without-knowing-your-pin-code/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Solved: How to Unlock Your Android Phone Without Knowing Your Pin Code</span></a>
