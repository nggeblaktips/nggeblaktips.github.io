Overview of the Device and Capabilities AirPods 1st generation are popular Apple wireless earbuds that were released in 2016. But can they connect to an Android device? The answer is, it depends on the Android device. Some Android devices with Bluetooth 4.2 or later can take advantage of the AirPods’ features, such as audio playback, battery level indicators, and more. Additionally, some Android devices may be able to connect to the AirPods and take benefit from their noise canceling and other audio capabilities. However, the range of features available depends on the device in question.\nThose with an Android smartphone that lacks the necessary Bluetooth 4.2 chip will not be able to connect to the AirPods.

For the most part, Apple devices are better when used with the AirPods as they are fully compatible with them and provide access to all of their features.\nThere are also third-party wireless earbuds that are compatible with some Android devices. These products are not made by Apple, but they may offer similar features, such as noise canceling, wireless charging, and longer battery life.
