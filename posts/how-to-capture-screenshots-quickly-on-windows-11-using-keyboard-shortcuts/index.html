This shortcut will take a screenshot of the active window and save it automatically to the Pictures folder on the user&rsquo;s computer. This saves users the time of having to open the Pictures folder and paste the screenshot manually.</p><p>Finally, the Shift + Prt Sc combination is the most advanced of all the screenshot shortcuts. This shortcut allows users to take a cropped screenshot of their screen. This is useful when users only want to capture a certain area of their screen. The image is also saved to the clipboard, so it can be pasted into any image editing software program.</p><h3 id=1-basics-of-taking-screenshot-in-windows-11>1.
