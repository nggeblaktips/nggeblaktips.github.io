If this doesn&rsquo;t work, you can try the variation of holding down the Power and Home button at the same time. This usually works on most Android devices.</p><p>Another way to take screenshots on Android even if an app blocks it is to use Google Assistant. All you have to do is open the Google Assistant and say take a screenshot and it will take a screenshot of your screen.

Taking Screenshots with Google Assistant<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-taking-screenshots-with-google-assistant>#</a></h3><p>Taking screenshots on Android phone is an important function for our daily use. However, some apps might not allow you to take screenshots of their pages or contents for security reasons. In this case, Google Assistant can be your savior!

All you need to do is to say, “Hey Google, take a screenshot.” By saying those simple words, your entire screen will magically be captured and saved in your Photos app. Once you have the screenshot, you can share it directly with your friends and colleagues. No complicated workarounds needed!</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/J6fawhB7pfs style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q: What are the 3 easy ways to take a screenshot on an Android device?
